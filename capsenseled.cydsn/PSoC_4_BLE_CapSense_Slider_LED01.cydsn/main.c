*                           THEORY OF OPERATION
*******************************************************************************
* This project will showcase the capability of PSoC 4 BLE to communicate 
* bi-directionally with a BLE Central device over custom services. The CapSense 
* custom service allows notifications to be sent to central device when 
* notifications are enabled. On the other hand, the RGB LED custom service allows 
* read and write of attributes under the RGB characteristics.
* This project utilizes CapSense component to check finger position on slider 
* and report this to central device over BLE. On the other hand, the control values 
* sent to PSoC 4 BLE is converted to respective color and intensity on the onboard  
* RGB LED. The BLE central device can be any BLE central device, including CySmart 
* mobile app or CySmart PC tool. 
* This project also inludes low power mode operation, idle for battery operated 
* devices. The project utlizes Deep Sleep feature of both BLESS and CPU to remain 
* in low power mode as much as possible, while maintaining the BLE connection and  
* data transfer. This allows the device to run on coin cell battery for long time.
*
* Note:
* The programming pins have been configured as GPIO, and not SWD. This is because 
* when programming pins are configured for SWD, then the silicon consumes extra
* power through the pins. To prevent the leakage of power, the pins have been set 
* to GPIO. With this setting, the kit can still be acquired by PSoC Creator or
* PSoC Programmer software tools for programming, but the project cannot be 
* externally debugged. To re-enable debugging, go to PSoC_4_BLE_CapSense_Slider_LED.cydwr 
* from Workspace Explorer, go to Systems tab, and set the Debug Select option to 'SWD'.
* Build and program this project to enable external Debugging.
*
* Refer to BLE Pioneer Kit user guide for details.
